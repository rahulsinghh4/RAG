# Physics Scientific Literature RAG Chatbot

Try out the application here!: https://physicsragchatbot.vercel.app/

This RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Chatbot specializes in the summaries of a large dataset of Physics Scientific Literature pulled from arxiv.org. The web chatbot can answer questions covering the following information from the papers: title, abstract, author(s), publication date, and other more specific details. The RAG app works by vectorizing the user text input and using a Euclidean similarity comparison to find relevant pieces of data in the Vector DB. The user input and the relevant context pulled from the DB are then combined and fed into the LLM to provide a response to the user.

Some features:

- 560,300 Physics Paper vectorized dataset available for context (with the option to increase to 1.7 million by upgrading the Vector DB)
- Multi-thread JSON data parsing and vectorizing
- Fast answers using real-time text streaming from Vercel AI

This chatbot is trained on data from arxiv.org as an example, but is totally domain agnostic. This project can be modified to run on any dataset either by modifying the built-in crawler or by uploading an alternative JSON dataset and then updating the LLM query template in route.tsx

### Tech Stack Overview & Interactions:

![overview-diagram](figs/overview_diagram.jpg)

## Setup

For local development, you can clone this repository by running the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/rahulsinghh4/RAG.git
```

This project contains two primary components: the data parser and the chatbot.

## Step 1: Data Parser

### Overview

My first attempt to pull data was using a web crawler based on scrapy. Scrapy was chosen due to my familiarity in Python, and scrapy is the most used crawler. After running the crawler on a trial test with a depth limit of 10 sites, the data that was vectorized was almost entirely unusable, as very little relevant information was actually gathered. In theory the scraper could have been customized to only pull the paper abstract data, but this customization would likely have taken significantly more time due to the difficulty of parsing HTML.

Another issue with using the crawler was that the arxiv.org website has a robots.txt file that limits scrapes to occur only in 15 second intervals. Collecting the data on the scale which was eventually used would have taken roughly 295 days at this rate. An alternative was to use the arxiv API to load the papers‘ abstract data, but this API also had a rate limiter that limited requests to occur at max every 3 seconds. This would result in a roughly two month turnaround for collecting the data

After this research, I ended up scrapping the crawler program and instead found a dataset from Kaggle sourced directly from ArXiv that provided roughly 1.7 million JSON objects that included all the relevant details about each paper. This dataset is updated roughly every week, so one drawback is that it won’t contain the latest Physics papers published.

This dataset was then downloaded and parsed in Python to convert the JSON objects into strings of length 1000 with a 100 character overlap in between strings. I chose Python due to the ease of development and the large libraries of code available for parsing JSON.

The data from the JSON objects in string form was then fed into OpenAI‘s embedding model text-embedding-ada-002, which provided a vectorized form of the data to use for similarity comparisons with the user input later. This specific model was chosen for embeddings, because it has a dimensionality of 1536 for its vector outputs, which corresponds to the limit on Upstash for its vector DB. Open AI‘s models are also very well-documented with plenty of examples to reference if any issues arise.

Finally, the text and vector data combined was uploaded to a vector database on Upstash, with a total of 900 thousand vectors stored, corresponding to approximately 560,000 papers.

I used Upstash for the vector database due to the simplicity of their APIs and the fact that they offer in-built vector similarity search operations that allow for easy search for relevant embeddings. One drawback of Upstash is the relatively limited docs available for errors and debugging — some of their old features (such as using an external embedding model like I did) are deprecated and it’s hard to find any documentation for the error codes. This resulted in a higher debugging time. Ultimately, their discord support channel contained an old thread that mentioned a workaround to the problem I was experiencing with their API.

In order to address rate limits with OpenAI‘s embedding model, a token counting estimation was added, along with an exponential backoff when hitting rate limits. The asyncio and ThreadPoolExecutor libraries in Python were also utilized to allow for asynchronous and parallel processing, due to the dataset being over 4 GB on size.

Batching was also used to optimize the vector upserts, so that the program was not dependent on the entire dataset being parsed, vectorized, and uploaded. This allowed for a partial dataset to be able to be used in the end due to various API limits.

Parsing, vectorizing, and uploading the data took the program roughly 16 hours (running in the background).

The OpenAI API key and the Upstash Vector DB URL and Token were stored in the Python venv activate file as environment variables for security.

### Data Parsing Diagram

![data-diagram](figs/data_diagram.jpg)

### Configure Environment Variables

Before you can run the data parser, you need to configure environment variables. The environment variabels allow you to securely store sensitive information, such as the API keys and tokens.

You can create an Upstash Vector DB [here](https://console.upstash.com/vector) and set 1536 as the vector dimensions and Euclidean as the similarity function. We set 1536 here because that is the amount needed by the embedding model we will use.

The following environment variables should be set:

```
# Upstash Vector credentials retrieved here: https://console.upstash.com/vector
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=****
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=****

# OpenAI key retrieved here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=****
```

### Install Required Python Libraries

To install the libraries, I suggest setting up a virtual Python environment. Before starting the installation, navigate to the `physragcrawler` directory.

To setup a virtual environment, first install `virtualenv` package:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Then, create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
# create environment
python3 -m venv venv

# activate environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, use the `requirements.txt` file to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</br>

Configure the environment variables in the venv/bin/activate file by adding the following under "export path":

```
export UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL="your_vector_rest_url"
export UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN="your_vector_rest_token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_open_ai_api_key"
```

### Download dataset

Download the data from `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv/data` and add it to the physragcrawler/physragcrawler/utils directory.

To run the data parser (and vectorizer), run the following command from the physragcrawler/physragcrawler/utils directory:

```bash
python3 parse_and_upload.py
```

## Step 2: Chatbot

### Overview

The chatbot was created using Next.js based on another open-source model. I chose Next.js due to prior experience with the framework when building my own website and due to the relevancy of the framework for modern web apps. I also already had the necessary libraries installed on my computer. The key features involved here were text streaming and rate limiting. Text streaming was achieved using Vercel AI in order for the user to see partial responses appear before they completed. This enhances user experience by allowing the user to start reading the response almost instantly. I used the LangChain framework for the LLM orchestration, as it comes pre-built with many of the features I was looking to use in my RAG app, such as the OpenAI API, the Vector DB, and native RAG workflows for context-retrieval. The LLM powering the front-end is gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. This was used as it was the model linked to an older LangChain project I used as a template, but in retrospect I would instead use gpt-4o-mini, as it has a larger context window (128,000 tokens) and a larger output token size (16,384). Changing the model is as simple as respecifying the model when calling the OpenAI() function.

The app was then hosted on Vercel, which was chosen for quick deployment and is a standard for RAG apps when I was researching for the project.

### Environment Variables

Before we can run the chatbot locally, we need to set the environment variables in the `.env.local` file.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```
# Redis tokens retrieved here: https://console.upstash.com/
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=

# Vector database tokens retrieved here: https://console.upstash.com/vector
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=

# OpenAI key retrieved here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=
```

The `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are needed for rate-limiting based on IP address. In order to get these env vars, go to the Upstash dashboard and create a Redis database.

Finally, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` environment variables you can get [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) which allows us to vectorize user queries and generate responses.

### Running the Program

Set up all neccessary environment variables and run `npm install` to install all local packages needed to run the app, you can start the chatbot using the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the chatbot live.

To customize the chatbot further, you can update the AGENT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE in the route.tsx file to match a different use case.

</br>

### Deployment

Visit `vercel.com` and follow the steps there to deploy a production version of the webapp!

## Debugging:

Most of my debugging was related to parsing the JSON file I used for the data, but after some assistance from google searches and Claude (Anthropic), I was able to successfully parse the data after about 30 minutes of trial and error.

Other debugging issues I had were related to missing imports due to having multiple versions of Python and Pip installed locally. Specifying the Python and pip versions when installing the packages solved this issue. The Python virtual environment also helped to organize the package installs to be local to the project.

## Future Changes

Future modifications (with more time):

- use an open source free embedding model to limit cost
- Expand input data to include the entire paper instead of just the paper abstract, title, author, and publication information
- Generalizing the RAG to work on any website dataset by configuring the crawler better
- Update the links to provide access to the actual pdfs instead of just a link to the dataset (the dataset unfortunately did not include links to the source materials)

#### Can you summarize new research findings about dark matter annihilation in the Draco constellation?

Here are some recent research findings related to dark matter annihilation in the Draco constellation:

1. Title: Dark Matter annihilation in Draco: new considerations on the expected gamma flux Abstract: A new estimation of the gamma-ray flux that we expect to detect from SUSY dark matter annihilation from the Draco dSph is presented using the DM density profiles compatible with the latest observations. This calculation takes also into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the telescope. We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe and interpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects to detect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST.
2. Title: Search for Dark Matter Annihilation in Draco with STACEE Abstract: For some time, the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy has garnered interest as a possible source for the indirect detection of dark matter. Its large mass-to-light ratio and relative proximity to the Earth provide favorable conditions for the production of detectable gamma rays from dark matter self-annihilation in its core. The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) is an air-shower Cherenkov telescope located in Albuquerque, NM capable of detecting gamma rays at energies above 100 GeV. We present the results of the STACEE observations of Draco during the 2005-2006 observing season totaling 10 hours of livetime after cuts.
3. Title: Dark matter searches with Cherenkov telescopes: nearby dwarf galaxies or local galaxy clusters? Abstract: In this paper, we compare dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters in order to elucidate which object class is the best target for gamma-ray DM searches with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). We have built a mixed dwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf galaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters (Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then compute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest modeling of their DM density profiles.
   I hope you find these recent research findings on dark matter annihilation in the Draco constellation informative and relevant to your inquiry.

   I hope you find these findings insightful and relevant to your interests in nuclear reactions at relativistic energies.

#### Can you provide three paper abstracts related to the quantum Hall effect?

Here are three paper abstracts related to the quantum Hall effect:

1. Title: "Observation of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in Graphene" Abstract: When electrons are confined in two dimensions and subjected to strong magnetic fields, the Coulomb interactions between them become dominant and can lead to novel states of matter such as fractional quantum Hall liquids. In these liquids, electrons linked to magnetic flux quanta form complex composite quasiparticles, which are manifested in the quantization of the Hall conductivity as rational fractions of the conductance quantum. The recent experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene has opened up a new avenue in the study of correlated 2D electronic systems, in which the interacting electron wavefunctions are those of massless chiral fermions. However, due to the prevailing disorder, graphene has thus far exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena, despite concerted experimental efforts and intense theoretical interest. Here, we report the full abstract here.
2. Title: "Quantum Hall effect in a one-dimensional dynamical system" Abstract: We construct a periodically time-dependent Hamiltonian with a phase transition in the quantum Hall universality class. One spatial dimension can be eliminated by introducing a second incommensurate driving frequency, so that we can study the quantum Hall effect in a one-dimensional (1D) system. This reduction to 1D is very efficient computationally and would make it possible to perform experiments on the 2D quantum Hall effect using cold atoms in a 1D optical lattice. Full abstract here.
3. Title: "Quantum Hall Effect in Quantum Electrodynamics" Abstract: We consider the quantum Hall effect in quantum electrodynamics and find a deviation from the quantum mechanical prediction for the Hall conductivity due to radiative antiscreening of electric charge in an external magnetic field. A weak universal dependence of the von Klitzing constant on the magnetic field strength, which can possibly be observed in a dedicated experiment, is predicted. Full abstract here.
   I hope you find these abstracts helpful for your research. If you need more information, feel free to ask!

#### What are the latest papers published in quantum mechanics?

Here are some of the latest papers published in quantum mechanics:

1. Title: "Principles and Dynamics of Quantum Mechanics" Abstract: The fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the probabilities of physical outcomes are obtained from the intermediate states and processes of the interacting particles, considered as happening concurrently. When the interaction is described by a potential, the total energy of the particle is equal to its total kinetic plus potential energies. The authors derive the Schrodinger and Dirac equations as the conditions the wavefunction must satisfy at each point in order to fulfill the corresponding energy equation. In their approach, quantum theory is tangible, experimentally justified, and theoretically consistent. Link to Paper
2. Title: "Quantum Nanomechanics" Abstract: Quantum Nanomechanics is the emerging field which pertains to the mechanical behavior of nanoscale systems in the quantum domain. Unlike the conventional studies of vibration of molecules and phonons in solids, quantum nanomechanics is defined as the quantum behavior of the entire mechanical structure, including all of its constituents--the atoms, the molecules, the ions, the electrons as well as other excitations. The relevant degrees of freedom of the system are described by macroscopic variables and quantum mechanics in these variables is the essential aspect of quantum nanomechanics. In spite of its obvious importance, however, quantum nanomechanics still awaits proper and complete physical realization. The authors provide a conceptual framework for defining quantum nanomechanical systems and their characteristic behaviors, and chart out possible avenues for the experimental realization of bona fide quantum nanomechanical systems. Link to Paper
3. Title: "Quantum mechanics and finite propagation speed" Abstract: This paper discusses the mathematical behavior of Schrödinger equation solutions in the context of quantum mechanics. The authors introduce a hypothesis that in reality, the speed of propagation of the perturbed sub-region borders is equal to the speed of light. Based on this hypothesis, they develop and analyze a finite propagation speed concept for non-relativistic quantum equations, leading to a local interpretation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics consistent with the principle of locality and free of local hidden variables. The theory is applied to the analysis of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, entanglement, and properties of perturbed matter waves. The authors prove that the formulated theory agrees with results of classical experiments on electron matter waves diffraction. Link to Paper

#### Can you provide the abstract of the paper titled "Exploring Quantum Entanglement in Spin Chains"?

The abstract of the paper titled "Creation and manipulation of entanglement in spin chains far from equilibrium" explores the investigation of creation, manipulation, and steering of entanglement in spin chains from the viewpoint of quantum communication between distant parties. The paper demonstrates how global parametric driving of the spin-spin coupling and/or local time-dependent Zeeman fields produce a large amount of entanglement between the first and the last spin of the chain. This occurs whenever the driving frequency meets a resonance condition, identified as "entanglement resonance". The approach marks a promising step towards an efficient quantum state transfer or teleportation in solid-state systems. Additionally, the paper proposes the generation and routing of multipartite entangled states by using symmetric tree-like structures of spin chains and studies the effect of decoherence on the resulting spin entanglement between the corresponding terminal spins.

#### Are there new methodologies proposed for gravitational wave detection?

Here are some recent methodologies proposed for gravitational wave detection:

1. Title: "Gravitational Wave Detection by Interferometry (Ground and Space)" Abstract: This paper discusses the mechanical and optical principles used in various long baseline systems in operation around the world, such as LIGO (USA), Virgo (Italy/France), TAMA300, LCGT (Japan), and GEO600 (Germany/U.K.), as well as in LISA, a proposed space-borne interferometer. It reviews recent science runs from the current generation of ground-based detectors and highlights the astrophysical results gained thus far. Link to Paper
2. Title: "An Evidence Based Time-Frequency Search Method for Gravitational Waves from Pulsar Glitches" Abstract: This paper reviews and expands on a Bayesian model selection technique for the detection of gravitational waves from neutron star ring-downs associated with pulsar glitches. The algorithm works with power spectral densities constructed from overlapping time segments of gravitational wave data. It introduces an extension to the algorithm which uses posterior information on the frequency content of detected signals to cluster events together. Link to Paper
3. Title: "A Bayesian Approach to the Detection Problem in Gravitational Wave Astronomy" Abstract: This paper explores an alternative, Bayesian approach to the detection problem in gravitational wave astronomy, considering prior information and the actual data in hand. It focuses on the evaluation of the detection, determining whether a candidate event is astrophysical in origin or some artifact created by instrument noise. Link to Paper
   These methodologies reflect the ongoing efforts to improve gravitational wave detection and analysis.

#### What is the primary contribution of the paper titled "Novel Approaches to String Theory Calculations"?

The primary contribution of the paper titled "Novel Approaches to String Theory Calculations" is to find evidence for putative new string theories that were not apparent in the perturbative analysis. The authors, Ramakrishnan Iyer, Clifford V. Johnson, and Jeffrey S. Pennington, present a novel approach that aims to uncover new string theories that may not have been evident in the perturbative analysis.

#### Are there any interdisciplinary works involving both physics and computer science?

Here are some interdisciplinary works involving both physics and computer science:

1. Title: "The evolution of interdisciplinarity in physics research" Abstract: The study explores the relationships between the sub-fields of Physics using the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) codes employed for self-categorization of articles published over the past 25 years (1985-2009). It observes a clear trend towards increasing interactions between the different sub-fields, indicating the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary physics research. Link to Paper
2. Title: "Biophysics software for interdisciplinary education and research" Abstract: The paper describes educational materials designed to aid in teaching undergraduates biophysics in an interdisciplinary manner. It discusses projects devised on topics that range from x-ray diffraction to the Hodgkin Huxley equations, which encourage collaboration and make extensive use of software written in Python/Scipy. The software can be used in lectures and in the teaching of more traditional biophysics courses. Link to Paper
3. Title: "NanoInfoBio: A case-study in interdisciplinary research" Abstract: The paper highlights potential barriers to effective research across disciplines and suggests possible mechanisms for removing these impediments, using a case study in the convergence of biology, computer science, engineering, and chemistry. It addresses the complex dynamics of interdisciplinarity and the need for effective interdisciplinary research. Link to Paper
   These works demonstrate the intersection of physics and computer science in interdisciplinary research.

#### Can you identify any contradictory findings between two papers on plasma physics?

I found two papers related to plasma physics:

1. Title: "Basic microscopic plasma physics unified and simplified by N-body classical mechanics" Abstract: The paper provides a compact unified introduction to phenomena in plasma physics without appealing to fluid or kinetic models, but by using Newton's second law for a system of N electrons in a periodic box with a neutralizing ionic background. It derives a rigorous equation for the electrostatic potential and extends the theory to accommodate a correct description of trapping or chaos due to Langmuir waves. Link to Paper
2. Title: "On quantum plasma: a plea for a common sense" Abstract: The paper argues that there is a very limited physical ground for the application of quantum plasma theory, suggesting that the theory has flourished in the past few years without much regard to the physical validity of the formulation or its connection to any real physical system. Link to Paper
   These papers present differing perspectives on the application and validity of quantum plasma theory in the context of plasma physics.
